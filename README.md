mapquiz is a MERN stack study tool for memorizing geographic locations.

## About
I discovered a lack of customizable and interactive geography tools while studying history at UNC-CH. The majority of quiz templates are confined to specific regions or limited to predefined questions - this is problematic for students who are required to memorize locations at a larger scale. 

mapquiz uses Google's Geocoding, Places and Maps APIs to generate a quiz for an unrestricted number of custom locations.
